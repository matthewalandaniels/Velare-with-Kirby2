Text: It's a funny thing, this job: Wedding Cinematography. Depending on who you are, the combination of those two words can mean many different things to you. It's now been almost four years since this daydream began: taking a creative hobby and turning it in to a business. But here we still are. We've learned a lot in these four years, made a lot of mistakes, had a lot of victories, experienced highs and lows as we navigated the tight-rope balancing act between running a business and creating. We had no idea wedding films would take across the globe as many times as it has, and had no idea how much we'd learn to love weddings right here in our home state of Colorado.  

We decided it was time to take a step backwards and start again, start fresh. You see when we started we had absolutely NO idea what we were doing, and that's the truth. (I should show you my very first wedding film...) We just loved it, loved making films, loved couples and weddings and the opportunities it presented us to shoot. We loved making unique films, films that were different but still connected to the couple, tugged on their heart strings, reminded them of the love they had for each other on their wedding day. So now we've taken a little time to reflect on the past few years, what worked, what didn't, and how we can continue to grow in our craft. We decided a re-brand was in order, a new face on this company and a way to start fresh. 

We've also taken the time to create a piece that is very close to our hearts. We gathered some of our favorite footage from the past few years and cut a 'reel' of sorts. Although to us it's much more than a reel. So without further adieu, (go full screen with this bad boy!) I give you *THIS IS LOVE*:
