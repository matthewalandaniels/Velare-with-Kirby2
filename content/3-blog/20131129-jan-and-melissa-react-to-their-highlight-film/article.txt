Text: Received one of the nicest gifts I could ever get from a couple, the chance to see them experiencing their highlight film for the first time! It was almost 2am in Belgium when I sent Jan and Melissa their film. I had given them a little hint it was coming that evening, and they stayed up super late (on a work night) to see it. They had the brilliant idea to capture themselves watching the film, and Iâ€™m so grateful they did.
You have to wait till Monday to see the film, but in the mean time, enjoy their amazing reactions, I did.
