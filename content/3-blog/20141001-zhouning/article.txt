Text: There are many challenges with film making, challenges you learn to overcome and they just become a part of your process. But changing what language a film is in, especially when I do not speak that language, was a new and exciting challenge. Nina and Lin had an amazing and beautiful story and we were honored to be a part of telling it. It was important for their friends and family in America and back home in China to be able to experience their wedding, so having it in both english and Mandarin was essential. It's amazing when having a new challenge like this, how your perspective changes. It caused us to think outside the box a little bit and re-injected some creativity and imagination in to our workflow. We had done this once before, with (link: http://dev.matthewalandaniels.com/projects/jan-and-melissa text: Jan and Melissa)'s wedding film being all in Dutch, and look forward to our next opportunity to tell a multi lingual story!
