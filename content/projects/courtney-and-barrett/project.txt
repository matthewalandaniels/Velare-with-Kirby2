Title: Courtney & Barrett

----

Location: Aspen

----

Description: Colorado is for lovers. Well, I don't think that's the official slogan, but Colorado was definitely for Courtney and Barrett. When a wedding as amazing as this pops up in our backyard it certainly is a treat for us. We love traveling but it's easy to forget about the amazing beauty and scenery that's right outside our door. I first met Courtney and Barrett over drinks near their home in NYC. As soon as they started telling me about their wedding I was hooked. When you combine such epic views and Colorado scenery with love like these two, it's a match made in heaven. Courtney put so much effort in to every tiny detail of this wedding, and it showed. It was a joy to be a part of, and a joy to be reminded of the beauty so close to home.
