Description: We love Chicago. Albeit cold and windy most every time we've been there, this big city has a warm spot in our hearts. Combine our love for this city with one of our favorite photographers, (link: http://www.chazcruz.com text: Chaz Cruz), and you have a recipe for success! 

From the couple:
'We never anticipated receiving a video of our wedding like the one Velare created for us months ago. To say there are no words to describe their brilliance through film would be a mass understatement to the amount of work and dedication Velare delves into their art. The angles, the moments, the people, the atmosphere was all perfectly captured by Tim and his crew. We are very grateful that he was able to put his imprint on our lives, but better yet, Tim was the one to welcomed us to marriage. We feel we are doing Velare a disservice by providing simply words to express our gratitude. Yet, over the course of time, you will realize there is nobody else out there who will not only take the time you understand you, but Velare forces themselves to find every couple's "essence" which is illustrated within every video they creates! Our day would never have felt the same without Velare capturing it the way they did. We have nothing but gratitude and appreciation for Velare's professional, yet comfortably appeasing approach.'
