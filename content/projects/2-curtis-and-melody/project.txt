Description: I remember getting Curtis and Melody's inquiry email. They spoke to me about their passion for graphic design, food, and their home, NYC. I immediately knew we'd get along and this would be a wedding to remember. NYC gets under your skin, in a good way. When you're there you're so enveloped in everything it has to offer it's easy to forget that there's a world outside of the city. Curtis and Melody's wedding took full advantage of everything the city had to offer. From getting ready at the Bryant Park Hotel with it's incredible views, to street performers and dodging NYC cabs to get some shots. Shift then from the city to the quiet, tranquil scenery at the New York Botanic Gardens for their reception. A perfect transition from city to nature, which I think both encapsulates this couple and their wedding!
