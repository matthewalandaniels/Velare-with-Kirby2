Title: Joe & Candice

----

Location: New Orleans

----

Description: Every now and then a wedding comes along that, for us, everything aligns perfectly. The sights, the sounds, and the emotions just allow us to observe, capture and have the most amazing film just waiting to be put together. Combining the culture and music of New Orleans in to a Second-Line filled, dance party of a reception which followed a day full of deep love, friends, family and beautiful New Orleans weather, for us it could not have been any better. It was a true honor to be a part of Joe and Candice's day, we hope you enjoy this trailer for their Highlight Film as much as we enjoyed putting it together.

From Candice:
"What an incredible way to re-live over and over a day that will leave us forever changed. We were so lucky to have Tim and his crew with us. They captured more than just footage. They captured unforgettable moments (and some wicked awesome dance moves). Thank you Tim and crew for slowing down a day that flew by so fast so we can drink up every beautifully lit drop!"
