Description: From Amber: 
The day was unquestionably breathtaking and they caught it perfectly.  Velare matched the gorgeous fall colors of the mountain surroundings with the rhythm of awesome music.  As a matter of fact, Tim unknowingly chose a song that happened to be one of our favorite bands!  What we didn’t realize was how Tim's team acquired so much footage.  The final product shows that they were literally everywhere!  The great part is we didn’t notice them all the time because they were not intrusive to the wedding party or guests, they had a clear plan and were competent in their details. We applaud that the simple things that mattered to us were shared…moments of excitement and fear, fellowship and love.  Each time we watch this we find more personal touches that we hadn’t noticed before.  There simply aren’t words nor money that we could give to thank him and his team for the enormous amount of hard work they put into this video.
