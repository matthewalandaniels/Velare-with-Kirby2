Description: From Melissa:
A few years back a wedding video appeared on the world wide web completely in reverse. It showed me a beautiful day of a creative couple who said "I do". The video sticked with me and when we were getting married ourselves I immediately thought about it again. I'm a wedding photographer and I love beautiful images so Velare was on the top of our wish list. Jan, my husband, was also a big fan of Velare's work and I secretly wrote an email to Tim to book them. Best decision ever! 

When Velare arrived at our wedding location, it was like they were old friends. They are awesome respected videographers but also beautiful people, who appreciate true love and that's what we needed on your wedding day. The love they have for their own families is reflected in their videos. The appreciation of everything small and beautiful is something they cherish. Every image is chosen with a lot of passion, perfectly fit with music. It just works.

We still watch our wedding film on a regular basis and we're sure we'll watch it again and again in the years to come. We will tell our future children about those awesome dudes who captured our wedding day ;-)
