Description: From Beth:
Stephen and I spent months trying to find a destination wedding venue that would be perfect for our wanderlust souls.  We researched New Zealand, Peru, even as far as Bhutan and as close as Park City for the perfect mountain location but one photo of Villa Mayana, up in the rainforest of Costa Rica, caught my eye and the pencil was finally put down.  By that point, we knew we wanted something that we felt would truly speak to us and what was most important to us - and for us, that was our family.  We spent an entire week on the property with just our immediate families, 15 of us in total, full of adventure and relaxation.  Our ceremony, held in the middle of that week, on a terrace that jutted out into the rainforest, was so perfect for us and very intimate.  Looking back, there is not one thing I would change about that day - not even the rain - and especially not the videographer!   

Working with Velare was genuinely everything we had expected.  They made us and our whole family for that matter, feel so comfortable - they really fit in perfectly to our intimate setting.  We were, and continue to be, so happy and grateful they were able and willing to come so far, and show up when they said they would (even with flight delays!!), to document this special day for us and for all the work they did the days surrounding the wedding.
