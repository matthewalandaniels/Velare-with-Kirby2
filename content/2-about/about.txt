About-headline: OUR STORY

----

About-text: In early 2011 Velare was born, but long before then it existed in the form of hobby and passion. Today we are still guided by that passion and don't do this just as a way to get by or punch the clock. We have an intense love for people and their stories, for moving pictures and for music. The emotions that can be conveyed by combining these elements keeps us excited with each new film. 

We decided early on that we wanted to infuse art and beauty in to wedding films and to take large risks of potential failure by making films we felt had true meaning and emotion - even if it meant going against the tide of the wedding industry and the status quo for wedding cinematography. It's what we still strive to do here every day: take chances and do what feels right in our hearts. 

Every couple is unique, every location is different and every day is new. We strive to make honest films that retain a sense of newness that will stand the test of time.
